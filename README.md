Smart Attendance System using LBPH Face Recognition


🚀 Overview

A real-time smart attendance system built with Python and OpenCV using LBPH face recognition.
It allows multiple students to register their faces, trains a model, and marks attendance automatically while distinguishing unknown faces.

💡 Features

Manual Face Registration – Users can see themselves and capture multiple face images.

Face Recognition – Recognizes registered students in real-time and marks attendance.

Confidence Thresholding – Prevents misidentifying unknown faces.

One Attendance Per Day – Ensures no duplicate entries.

Modular Design – Separate scripts for registration, training, and recognition.
